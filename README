This is the README for CPAN::Nearest version 0.09_01.

CPAN::Nearest is a "module" for the Perl computer programming language, a
library of computer code to install on a computer.  This document contains four
sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

CPAN::Nearest - find the nearest module to a given name.

This module provides a way of searching for CPAN modules whose name
may be misspelt. For example, if a user accidentally types
"Lingua::Stopwords" when looking for the module "Lingua::StopWords",
the common cpan clients will not be able to function:

    cpan Lingua::Stopwords

gives

    Warning: Cannot install Lingua::Stopwords, don't know what it is.
    Try the command

    i /Lingua::Stopwords/

    to find objects with matching identifiers.

and

    cpanm Lingua::Stopwords

gives

    ! Finding Lingua::Stopwords on cpanmetadb failed.
    ! Finding Lingua::Stopwords on search.cpan.org failed.
    ! Finding Lingua::Stopwords () on mirror http://www.cpan.org failed.
    ! Couldn't find module or a distribution Lingua::Stopwords ()

CPAN::Nearest supplies a spelling-mistake tolerant search for the most
similar name, intended for people making tools like "cpan", "cpanm",
"pm-uninstall", and anything else which needs to use the CPAN
packages list. CPAN::Nearest was written to be fast enough for
practical use.

CPAN::Nearest was inspired by the helpful "git" version control
system, which provides suggestions for spelling mistakes.

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following websites:

    * http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Nearest
    * http://metacpan.org/release/CPAN-Nearest

(These links go to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your computer
using

    perldoc CPAN::Nearest

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. INSTALLATION

To install the module from CPAN, use

    cpan CPAN::Nearest

If you have the App::cpanminus installer, you may prefer

    cpanm CPAN::Nearest

To install the module from the source file, CPAN-Nearest-0.09_01.tar.gz, follow
this sequence of commands:

    tar xfz CPAN-Nearest-0.09_01.tar.gz
    cd CPAN-Nearest-0.09_01
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If you want to test the module before installing it, use "make test" after
"make" and before "make install".
